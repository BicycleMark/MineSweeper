feat: Refactor to feature-based architecture

- Removed duplicate files in Models/ and ViewModels/ folders
- Standardized on using Features/Game/Models and Features/Game/ViewModels
- Kept Services/ folder for cross-cutting concerns
- Fixed namespace references in XAML and code files
- Added JSON converters to the Features/Game/Models namespace
- Updated navigation to use new feature-organized pages
- Fixed platform-specific orientation code to use fully qualified names

This commit completes the transition to a clean feature-based architecture 
with proper separation of concerns:

1. Features/ - Contains domain-specific code organized by feature
2. Services/ - Contains cross-cutting technical concerns

The app now has a more maintainable structure with clearer dependencies
and better organization.
