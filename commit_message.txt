- Implement factory patterns for lazy initialization of services
- Add explicit dependency resolution to improve performance
- Optimize service lifetimes (singletons for shared services, transient for UI)
- Configure handler placeholders for future rendering optimizations
- Add detailed comments explaining performance considerations
