Code cleanup: Remove unused files and methods

This commit improves code maintainability by removing unused code:

1. Removed unused files:
   - MainPageDebug.xaml and MainPageDebug.xaml.cs
   - GameGrid.xaml and GameGrid.xaml.cs

2. Updated references:
   - Removed MainPageDebug references from AppShell.xaml
   - Removed MainPageDebug route registration in AppShell.xaml.cs
   - Updated error handling in App.xaml.cs to use a simple error page
   - Removed MainPageDebug registration in MauiProgram.cs

3. Cleaned up unused methods in MainPage.xaml.cs:
   - Removed SetHelpButtonImage (commented out in constructor)
   - Removed GetAllEmbeddedImages and GetCategorizedImages
   - Removed OnSquareImageGridExampleClicked, OnLedControlExampleClicked,
     and OnHelpButtonClicked (unused event handlers)

These changes reduce code complexity while preserving all functional
components of the application. Example files demonstrating control usage
were kept as they provide valuable documentation.

The build now succeeds for .NET and Android targets, with only a clang
error in the MacCatalyst build that is unrelated to these changes.
