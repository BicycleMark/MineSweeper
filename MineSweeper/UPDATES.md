ACTION REQUIRED:
✗- Java Development Kit (JDK) - The selected Java SDK version 11.0.16.1 is not recommended. Ensure the required JDK version 17.0.12 is configured by installing the JDK, and then setting the JDK at the preferred level.
	1. Install the JDK:
		- From the command palette, choose '.NET MAUI: Configure Android', select 'How to configure Android', and follow the instructions.
	2. Set the JDK via one of the following routes:
		- (Recommended) Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to define the Java SDK path at the machine level.
		- Configure the path to be used by adding the MSBuild property JavaSdkDirectory in the '.csproj' file to define the Android SDK path at the project level.
		- From the command palette, select '.NET MAUI: Configure Android', and then 'Java SDK Preferred location' to set the preferred Java SDK path at the user/workspace level.
SUGGESTION:
- Android SDK - There are optional Android SDK components required for emulator usage that we recommend to installed/upgraded: "system-images/android-35/google_apis/arm64-v8a".
	1. Install the Android SDK components:
		- From the command palette, choose '.NET MAUI: Configure Android', select 'How to configure Android', and follow the instructions.
		- Alternatively, you can try installing the components by opening a Terminal, navigating to directory '/Users/markwardell/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin' and then running: './sdkmanager "system-images;android-35;google_apis;arm64-v8a"'. Then, from the command palette, choose '.NET MAUI: Configure Android', and 'Refresh Android environment'.
